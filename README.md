# Fragments of You
Fragments of You a platformer all about collecting the parts of your partner. While going about collecting these parts, the player will need to sacrifice their own parts to unlock those of their partners. In losing parts the player will also lose certain movement options associated with the parts lost.
As a team, we value communication and patience. We would like for collaborators to maintain these values with us. Additionally, we will be working with Unity as our game engine and Git for our version control.
